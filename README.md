# CatBaseBubble
The Cat from The Battle Cats' base menu on your desktop! (By SaiasMadrid)

This program is a .exe file. When run, it will display the cat from the Cat Base in the game with (some) of its flavor text.
You can drag and move the window as you wish for convenience, and click on the bubble to change its text!

Note: It will be running always on top, it is also a transparent window so you need to close it another way not relying on the top bar.
