# CatBaseBubble
The Cat from The Battle Cats' base menu on your desktop! (By SaiasMadrid)

This program is a .exe file. When run, it will display the cat from the Cat Base in the game with (initially) little text.
By right clicking, you can access a menu to add, list, edit and remove phrases that you yourself can write for the Cat to say (don't abuse the power!).
These phrases are saved every time you make an action and will be ready to use every time you run the program!

You can drag and move the window as you wish for convenience, and click on the bubble to change its text!

Note: It will be running always on top, it is also a transparent window but it can be closed with by right clicking -> Exit.
